## CRAFT: Character-Region Awareness For Text detection
Official Pytorch implementation of CRAFT text detector | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01941) | [Pretrained Model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jk4eGD7crsqCCg9C9VjCLkMN3ze8kutZ) | [Supplementary](https://youtu.be/HI8MzpY8KMI)


### Overview
Modified PyTorch implementation for CRAFT text detector that effectively detect text area by exploring each character region and affinity between characters and redacts the region. 

## Getting started
### Install dependencies
#### Requirements
- PyTorch>=0.4.1
- torchvision>=0.2.1
- opencv-python>=3.4.2
- check requiremtns.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training
The code for training is not included in this repository, and we cannot release the full training code for IP reason.


* Run with pretrained model
``` (with python 3.7)
python test.py --trained_model=[weightfile] --test_folder=[folder path to test images]
```

The result image and socre maps will be saved to `./result` by default.
(This version doesn't check for corrupt/empty files.)

### Arguments
* `--trained_model`: pretrained model
* `--text_threshold`: text confidence threshold
* `--low_text`: text low-bound score
* `--link_threshold`: link confidence threshold
* `--cuda`: use cuda for inference (default:True)
* `--canvas_size`: max image size for inference
* `--mag_ratio`: image magnification ratio
* `--poly`: enable polygon type result
* `--show_time`: show processing time
* `--test_folder`: folder path to input images
* `--refine`: use link refiner for sentense-level dataset
* `--refiner_model`: pretrained refiner model
